# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 

This assignment submission is meant to illustrate responsive design via a personal portfolio-style website that primarily uses a pre-existing framework to create modern-looking and responsive elements.

The site will consist of 3 pages: a home page that also serves as an 'About Me' section; a portfolio page to display relevant projects; and a contact page to show contact links and provide a form for sending a message.
